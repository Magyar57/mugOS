Implementation plan:
- [X] Hello world bootloader
- [X] Two-stage bootloader
- [X] Switch to protected mode
- [X] Bootloader's FAT driver
- [X] Hello world kernel
- [X] Kernel IDT/GDT
- [X] Handle interrupts (ISR)
- [X] Handle hardware interrupts (IRQ)
- [ ] Implement a keyboard driver subsystem (PS/2 keyboard driver + PS/2 controller driver)
- [ ] Make my C tetris compatible-ish (run in ring 0)
- [ ] Memory detection
- [ ] kmalloc
- [ ] Userland
- [ ] Bootloader: abandon Legacy in favor of UEFI
- [ ] Kernel FAT32 driver
- [ ] Filesystem management

Modifications:
- [ ] When implementing USB, intialize and disable USB legacy support BEFORE initializing the PS/2 controller
- [ ] With ACPI implemented, finish step 2 of the 8042 PS/2 controller initalization
