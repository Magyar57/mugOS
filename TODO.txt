Roadmap:
- [X] Hello world bootloader
- [X] Two-stage bootloader
- [X] Switch to protected mode
- [X] Bootloader's FAT driver
- [X] Hello world kernel
- [X] Kernel IDT/GDT
- [X] Handle interrupts (ISR)
- [X] Handle hardware interrupts (IRQ)
- [X] Implement PS/2 drivers (controller and devices)
- [X] Implement a keyboard driver subsystem
- [X] Port my C Tetris to mugOS (run in ring 0)
- [X] Double fault handler
- [ ] Memory detection
- [ ] kmalloc
- [ ] Serial output driver
- [ ] Userland
- [ ] Bootloader: abandon Legacy in favor of UEFI
- [ ] Kernel FAT32 driver
- [ ] Filesystem management

Modifications:
- [ ] When implementing USB, intialize and disable USB legacy support BEFORE initializing the PS/2 controller
- [ ] With ACPI implemented, finish step 2 of the 8042 PS/2 controller initalization
- [ ] With proper executable and lib support, remove callbacks from the keyboard driver when its owner exits

Notes:
- Current PS/2 implementation purposely does not support hot-plug (as it was not designed for it originally...)
