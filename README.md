# mugOS

This is a custom operating system, written for learning and experimentation purposes during my free time.

## Documentation

To see more informations about the OS capabilities and future plans, see the [Roadmap.md](./Docs/Roadmap.md).
This is strongly recommended.

For general documentation, see the [documentation folder](./Docs/).

## Build and run

If you want to quickly run the OS, download one of the available releases,
and run it in QEMU: `qemu-system-i386 -fda floppy.img`.

Try the [tetris release](https://github.com/Magyar57/mugOS/releases/tag/v0.2-tetris) !
It is a modified version of v0.2, made as a Proof of Concept, to show that the OS is able to run
a relatively complex game such as tetris.

For more information about building, running and debugging, see the [running documenation](./Docs/Running.md)
