# mugOS

This is a custom operating system, written for learning and experimentation purposes during my free time.

The [General documentation](./Docs/General.md) documents the OS capabilities, and a [roadmap](./Docs/Roadmap.md) is available.

## Try it yourself !

If you want to quickly run the OS, download one of the available releases,
and run it in QEMU: `qemu-system-x86_64 -fda floppy.img`.

Try the [tetris release](https://github.com/Magyar57/mugOS/releases/tag/v0.2-tetris) !
It is a modified version of v0.2, made as a Proof of Concept, to show that the OS is able to run
a relatively complex game such as tetris.

For more information about [building](./Docs/Building.md) and [running](./Docs/Running.md), see the corresponding documentation.
